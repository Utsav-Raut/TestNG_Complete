The Asserts helps us verify the terms of the conditions and decide whether the test has failed or passed.
Without throwing any exception, a test is considered to be only successful.
Assertions is the best way to perform any kind of validations in the tests.
When a assertion fails, the test script prevents execution, unless it is made in some form.

There are two types of asserts in Selenium:
	Soft Assert
	Hard Assert
	
=================================================================================================================

Hard assertion:

A Hard Assertion is a type of assertion that instantly throws an exception when a assert statement fails and continues with the next test in the test suite.
To achieve this, we need to handle the Assertion error which is thrown with a catch block like the Java block.
After the suit is completed, after completion of the execution, particular test has been marked as passed instead of FAIL.

Different Hard Assert Statements:
	Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected);
	Assert.assertNotEquals(actual,expected,Message);
	Assert.assertTrue(condition);
	Assert.assertFalse(condition);
	Assert.assertNull(object);
	Assert.assertNotNull(object);

================================================================================================================

Soft assertion:

To deal with the disadvantage of Hard Assertions, a custom error handler provided by TestNG is called soft Assertion.
Soft Assertions is definitely the assertions type that does not throw an exception when a assertion fails and continues in the next phase after the assert statement.
This is usually used when our test requires many assertions to execute and the user wants to execute all the assertions / code before failing / skipping the tests.
 

Different Soft Assert Statements:

	softAssert.assertTrue(false);
	softAssert.assertEquals(1, 2);
	softAssert.assertAll();

If you forget to call assertAll() at the end of your test, the test will pass even if any assert objects threw exceptions.
So donâ€™t forget to add assertAll()
